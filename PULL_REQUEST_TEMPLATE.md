I am very happy to accept PRs for the set of VSTS Extensions in this Repo. Here are a few guide lines that are really helpful if you follow when submitting PRs

- In the PR comment state the problem you are addressing
- Add a new release line entry in to the extensions readme.md file (usually found at the end of the file) that 
  - does an increment of the minor version number e.g. 1.2 to 1.3
  - lists the Issue/PR number related to the change
  - a brief single line comment as change made
  - if the change adds new parameters update the appropriate documentation
- If you are willing, enable me as the Repo owner, to edit your fork that contains your PR so I can add missing items such as the readme.md
